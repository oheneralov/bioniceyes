Sensory substitution
This technology for the blind people offers to see with ears through image-to-sound renderings. Images are converted into sound. In theory this could result into synthetic vision with truly visual sensations ("qualia"), due to the neural plasticity of the human brain through training. 

1 Camera captures an image.
2 Thw edge of an image is detected
3. The edge coordinates are found
4. the matrix of coordinates are voiced (matrix consists of values 0...250 where 0 = dark and 250 = white)
a. if brightnest > 10 it is voiced due to its coordinates (signal depends on the x coordinate in the row). X coordinate is described by a note a,b,c,d,e,d,f
b. each row is described by a reserved signal
