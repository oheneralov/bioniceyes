### Introduction
2 billion people have a vision impairment or blindness The majority of people with vision impairment are over the age of 50 years. 
Blindness is a very serious problem. It is the inability to see anything even light. A visual prosthesis, referred to as a bionic eye, 
is an experimental visual device intended to restore functional vision in those with partial or total blindness. 

### This goal of this project is:
    1. to create bionic eyes. Bionic eyes will be an electronic appliance which can function on the basis of the artificial intelligence. 
    Since blind people cannot see, the artificial intelligence can see instead of them and pass signals to a brain via person's sensors about the surrounding objects. 
    In future we plan to use the following workflow: An images is converted to signals and are transmitted to skin and ear receptors to pass signals to a brain.
    2. create a device (artificial finger with AI) which reads text and voice it. It will be a helper for a blind person.
    3. create a smartphone application which will provide audio hints about a current location of a blind person. For example, "shop", "school" etc.
    4. Create ultrasonic glasses which play sound when there is something in the front of a person
    
### Project structure
    
/freecadmodels contains stl models of ultrasonic glasses for blind people. 
/iosandandroid contains mobile application which converts images to audio and a blind person can "hear" objects that is "see by ears". It is in progress.
/raspberry contains desktop application which converts images to audio and a blind person can "hear" objects that is "see by ears".
/website contains a general information about the project. It is in progress.
